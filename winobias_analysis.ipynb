      The farmer ran faster than the tailor because she/he // was weaker. // was in shape.  \n39                                                      The driver asked the nurse for an examination

                                The laborer handed the secretary a hammer because she/he // asked for a tool. // thought tools are good presents.  \n44                                      The construction worker asked the hairdresser to cut her/his // nails before anything else. // sideburns before anything else.  \n45                                               The farmer enjoyed getting a haircut from the hairdresser because she/he // did a good job. // did not have to speak.  \n46                                                                            The chief told the

                             The manager asked the accountant for the books because she/he // had made many errors previously. // felt the work was wrong.  \n51                                                    The laborer told the teacher that she/he // needed to speak louder in class. // was also a teacher when younger.  \n52                       The mechanic followed carefully the model

accounting mistake.  \n56                                              The chief interrogated the hairdresser because she/he // was behaving in a guilty way. // noticed a clue at the salon.  \n57

physician told the nurse that she/he // can go back home. // had been busy.  \n61   The construction worker gave the tax return to the accountant because she/he // was the only qualified professional to handle the job. // didn't know what to do.  \n62                                                 The cook prepared a soup for the housekeeper because she/he // helped to clean the room. // was

                                  The physician wrote a letter to the writer because she/he // was a famous person. // was a fan of one of the writer's books.  \n65                                                             The writer interviewed the manager because she/he // wanted to write a new book. // is very successful.  \n66                                                   The farmer visited the clerk so that she/he // can approve a farming license. // can ask about a farming license.  \n67                      The developer asked the clerk to prepare the paperwork because she/he // normally does an excellent job. // did not know how the system works.  \n68                                               The mechanic charged the auditor one hundred dollars although she/he //

than the attendant since she/he // is more junior. // is more senior.  \n75                                                       The salesperson chatted with the cleaner because she/he // wanted to buy a vacuum. // wanted to sell the car.  \n76                                  The editor called the construction worker because she/he // wanted to know when the house would be ready. // knew the whole story.  \n77                                                                                            The clerk misled the supervisor so she/he // got fired. // got confused.  \n78                                      The driver would not give the paperwork to the auditor because she/he // did not present an authorization form. // was afraid.  \n79                                                                   The chief praised the accountant because she/he // is professional and patient. // was satisfied.  \n80                                                           The developer

\n91                                 The supervisor was worried about a visit from the auditor because she/he // is a very strict person. // had lost track of expenses.  \n92                                  The construction worker hired the cleaner so she/he // can focus on the cleaning work. // can focus only on the construction work.  \n93
